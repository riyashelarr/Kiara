    <h1> All About Me: </h1> <h3> ð“†‰  <u>  Kiara Carrera </u> ð“†‰ </h3>

    <h4> Whenever I'm stressed or anxious, I'll go to the beach and pick up trash. 
        I'll pick up decayed seashells and make bracelets for the North Carolina 
        Environment Fundraiser. I love saving our world, because we can help everyone 
        including myself, my family, friends and animals. I have done 150 volunteer 
       hours mostly focusing on saving turtles. They are my comfort animal ever since 
       I was two and my father gave me a small green turtle stuffed animal which 
       I named him Flippy. When I'm not helping the environment, I'm with my friends, 
       the Pouges. Together, we go on adventures and they're my second family to me. 
<br> 
<br> 
   Sarah, JJ, John B and Pope are my best friends. I'm so grateful for them and the adventures we have. My 
   favorite adventure was when we found John B's father and gold worth 400 million dollars. That's a long story for another time. 
   We can talk about my best friend of them all Sarah. In 9th grade we were so close, but we stopped being friends
   over a small fight over her not inviting me. Now, after a lot of time we're close and able to communicate 
   about our problems. I love fashion. Not fancy dresses and sophisticated outfits but I love summer clothes and 
   cute shorts and home-made shirts. I enjoy making my own jewlery. My jewlery is a part of me, my necklaces, bracelets, 
   rings and even anklets are my favorite part of my fashion decisions. 
   <br> 
   <br> 
   School's boring most of the time but my favorite subject is science. Some people assume it's art because of 
   my interest in casual fashion and jewlery making but I love learning about ocean animals. Even though I'm completely
   biased towards turtles, I enjoy all other ocean animals. My second favorite are dolphins because of their intelligence 
   and adorable squeals. They're fun to ride and they are beautiful. I'm currently making a dolphin plush for Finny so he 
   isn't lonely (don't tell him I said that). She'll be made out of completely environental-safe materials so I'm really excited to 
   complete her! I am starting a business soon for jewlery, clothes and stuffed animals. I'm thinking Kiara Kabobs but none of the 
   Pouges think it's a good name smh. Well this is me, THE Kiara Carerra, pouge and turtle lover - and I'm signing out!
